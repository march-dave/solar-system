# Solar System

A simple Next.js project that displays information about the planets in our solar system.

## Development

This project uses the Next.js App Router and TypeScript. To run locally with all dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Because this environment may not allow installing packages, the project is provided without the `node_modules` directory.

## Linting

Run the linter with:

```bash
npm run lint
```

The script checks for `node_modules/.bin/next` and exits with an error if the dependency is missing.
